# OOP Project

This task aimed to emulate the function of an EB Games store. The user has the option to purchase items such as games and consoles. In the background, the stock is updated based on the customer's recent purchases.

The code was completed in C++ and the project incorporated many OOP concepts, such as inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation and abstract classes.
